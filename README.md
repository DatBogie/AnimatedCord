# AnimatedCord
A *very* simple Discord theme aimed at animating clickable elements.
Targetting Vencord; BetterDiscord is and will (likely) remain untested.

# Installation
To install, do as you would with any other Vencord theme:
1. [Download](https://bit.ly/DownloadAnimatedCord) `AnimatedCord.theme.css`.
2. Navigate to your themes folder (Typically `~/.config/Vencord/themes` on Linux, `%APPDATA%\Vencord\themes` on Windows). Alternatively, open Discord, go to `User Settings > Themes` and click `Open Themes Folder`.
3. Cut/paste `AnimatedCord.theme.css` into the foremention folder.
4. Open `User Settings` in Discord, and navigate to the `Themes` tab.
5. If you do not see `AnimatedCord`, simply click the `Load missing Themes` button, and it should appear!

> Note: compatability with other themes is not guaranteed by any means; **this theme will not work with certain themes**. I have tested AnimatedCord with SkeuoCord, and found that certain buttons (namely the `User Settings`, `Deafen`, and `Mute` buttons) fail to animate.
