# AnimatedCord <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DatBogie/AnimatedCord/refs/heads/main/AnimatedCordLogo.png" height="25">
A *very* simple Discord theme aimed at animating clickable elements.
Targetting Vencord; BetterDiscord is and will (likely) remain untested.<br>
### [**DOWNLOAD HERE**](https://bit.ly/DownloadAnimatedCord)
[**Preview Theme**](https://gibbu.github.io/ThemePreview/?file=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/DatBogie/AnimatedCord@refs/heads/main/AnimatedCord.theme.css) via Gibbu's [ThemePreview](https://github.com/Gibbu/ThemePreview)
> Note: ThemePreview is not perfect; there are various things that the real AnimatedCord theme does that aren't visible via the preview.

# Installation
To install, do as you would with any other Vencord theme:
1. [**Download**](https://github.com/DatBogie/AnimatedCord?tab=readme-ov-file#download-here) `AnimatedCord.theme.css`.
2. Navigate to your themes folder (Typically `~/.config/Vencord/themes` on Linux, `%APPDATA%\Vencord\themes` on Windows). Alternatively, open Discord, go to `User Settings > Themes` and click `Open Themes Folder`.
3. Cut/paste `AnimatedCord.theme.css` into the foremention folder.
4. Open `User Settings` in Discord, and navigate to the `Themes` tab.
5. If you do not see `AnimatedCord`, simply click the `Load missing Themes` button, and it should appear!

> Note: compatability with other themes is not guaranteed by any means; **this theme will not work with certain themes**. I have tested AnimatedCord with SkeuoCord, and found that certain buttons (namely the `User Settings`, `Deafen`, and `Mute` buttons) fail to animate.

# Releases
Releases are **NOT** intended for downloading the latest version, but rather for archival purposes.<br>**Please download from [here](https://github.com/DatBogie/AnimatedCord?tab=readme-ov-file#download-here) instead of the latest release!**
> Note: new releases will typically be created when existing elements' animations are significantly changed (whether on purpose or accidentally).
